Angelic Lantern. Floats in a square, shedding bright light in a radius of 20 squares. Any character standing in a space containing an angelic lantern and using an attack with the either the divine or the radiant keyword gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls per tier. An angelic lantern winks out of existence at the end of the turn that it first grants a bonus to such attacks.
Astral Flame. Fiery liquid that sheds bright light in a radius of 20 squares. The astral flame completely fills a square; costs 1 square of movement to enter; any creature entering an astral flame square or starting his or her turn in a square containing astral flame takes 10 radiant damage per tier. However, a character adjacent to this space can coat his or her weapon or implement with the stuff as a minor action. Until the end of the encounter, all attacks using that weapon or implement gain the radiant keyword.
Blast Cloud. The squares containing the cloud are lightly obscured. When a burst or a blast created by a fire, force, lightning, psychic, or thunder power touches a square ofblast cloud, the size of the burst or blast is increased by 1.
Blood Midge Cloud. The squares occupied by the cloud are lightly obscured, and the cloud is difficult terrain. If no creature is in the cloud when a creature starts its turn within 3 squares of a blood midge cloud, the cloud moves 5 squares and attempts to cover as many living creatures as possible. If an area or close attack includes squares occupied by the cloud, the cloud is destroyed in those squares. If a cloud is broken into smaller pieces by an attack, each piece acts as a separate terrain feature.
Blood Rock. A creature standing in a square of blood rock can score a critical hit on a natural die roll of 19 or 20.
Bolt Stone. When a creature enters a square of bolt stone, it takes 5 lightning damage per tier. Roll a d20; on a 10 or higher, the bolt stone's energy is discharged, and the stone becomes inert. Otherwise, the lightning energy is transferred to all unoccupied squares adjacent to the origin square, and those squares become bolt stone.
Cave Slime. A creature that enters a square filled with cave slime must succeed at an Acrobatics check or fall prone.
Choke Frost. Each time a creature enters a square of choke frost, it takes a –1 penalty to speed. As a move action, a creature can negate this penalty. Creatures that have the cold keyword are immune to this effect.

Creeping Ice. Any creature that starts and ends its turn in any square of creeping ice takes 5 cold damage per tier.
Defiled Ground. Undead gain a +1 bonus to rolls to recharge their powers while on defiled ground. In addition, if an undead creature is reduced to 0 hit points while on defiled ground, roll a d20; on a 10 or higher, the undead creature rises with 1 hit point on its next turn. If radiant damage reduces an undead creature to 0 hit points, it can't rise again in this manner.

Divine Blood. Any character who ends his or her move in the pool gains 5 temporary hit points per tier, but takes a –1 penalty to attack rolls and checks from the confusing visions and memories assailing his or her mind. This penalty remains until the temporary hit points are lost. Although the visions are random and seemingly nonsensical, occasionally the visions impart important information that is useful to the character experiencing them.
Doomlight Crystal. A fist-sized doomlight crystal emits dim yellow light in a 3-square radius. If a character in a square with a doomlight crystal is hit by a close or an area attack, the crystal is destroyed as well - and the gas inside it explodes, dealing 5 damage per tier to the character in its square.
Eldritch Influx. As a standard action, a character in a square of eldritch influx can channel its energy to recharge an expended magic item power. Recharging a power in this way does not grant the item's wielder the ability to make use ofmore daily magic item powers between milestones. Using an eldritch influx for this purpose depletes its energy, and it can't be used again until 24 hours have passed.
Elemental Seepage. Fills up to 4 contiguous squares. An attack power with one or more keywords corresponding to the types of energy comprising the seepage and used within 5 squares of the elemental seepage gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls per tier.

Whenever an energy crystal is attacked by a power with the cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder keyword, it takes no damage from the effects of those energy types. Until the end of the next turn of the creature making the attack, any creature entering or starting its turn adjacent to the crystal takes 5 damage per tier of the energy type(s) absorbed by the crystal. If the energy crystal is destroyed after absorbing energy but before the end of its attacker’s next turn, it explodes, dealing 10 damage per tier of the energy type(s) it has absorbed to all creatures within 3 squares of the energy crystal.
Energy Node. A creature that starts its turn in an energy node's square can spend a minor action while in the square to regain a single encounter or recharge power. Using a node for this purpose depletes its energy, and it can't be used again until 24 hours have passed.
Erratic Portal. When a creature ends its move on an erratic portal square, it makes an immediate saving throw. On a save, that creature can teleport up to 5 squares per tier as a free action. On a failed saving throw, the creature can teleport up to 2 squares per tier as a free action, and it takes 10 lightning damage per tier. If the creature chooses not to teleport, it still takes the lightning damage.

Hellfire. A square of hellfire sheds bright light in a radius of 20 squares; adjacent creatures add the fire keyword to their ranged attacks; a creature entering or starting a turn in hellfire takes ongoing 5 fire damage per tier. A failed saving throw against hellfire ongoing fire damage also increases the ongoing fire damage by 5 per tier (up to a limit of three times the original ongoing damage).

Illusory Wall.
Infernal Fumes. Squares filled with infernal fumes are lightly obscured. The fumes can move up to 4 squares each round. A creature that ends its turn in a square of infernal fumes takes 5 fire and poison damage per tier and is dazed until the end of its next turn.

Martyr's Monument. The monument grants a +2 bonus to saving throws to all creatures within 5 squares of it. In addition, a creature adjacent to the monument can touch it as a minor action to make a saving throw. Each time a creature touches the monument to make a saving throw, roll a d20; on a 5 or lower, the monument loses all its magical properties for 24 hours.
Loadstone. It is difficult terrain, and ranged attacks that trace line of sight through it take a –2 penalty to attack rolls.

Phase Mist. A square of phase mist is lightly obscured. A creature that starts its turn in a square of phase mist gains phasing until the end of its turn.

Thunder Shards. Squares of thunder shards are difficult terrain. If a creature makes a melee attack against a target in a thunder shard square, roll a d20; on a 10 or higher, both the attacker and the target take 5 thunder damage and are pushed 1d4 squares from each other.
Whirlwind. A creature that enters a whirlwind moves a distance and direction determined by the strength of the whirlwind. An affected creature can fight against the wind by spending squares of movement to reduce the distance the wind slides it. Only one whirlwind square can affect a creature at a time. If the wind slides the creature through or into another whirlwind square, that square has no effect. A whirlwind can also move creatures upward. A creature that ends its turn outside of a whirlwind square and aloft falls to the ground.
